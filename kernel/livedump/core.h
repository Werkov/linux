/*
 * Request queue consists of 2 kfifos: pend, pool
 *
 * Processing between the two kfifos:
 *  (1)handle_page READs one request from POOL.
 *  (2)handle_page makes the request and WRITEs it to PEND.
 *  (3)kthread READs the request from PEND and submits bio.
 *  (4)endio WRITEs the request to POOL.
 *
 * kfifo permits parallel access by 1 reader and 1 writer.
 * Therefore, (1), (2) and (4) must be serialized.
 * (3) need not be protected since livedump uses only one kthread.
 *
 * (1) is protected by pool_r_lock.
 * (2) is protected by pend_w_lock.
 * (4) is protected by pool_w_lock.
